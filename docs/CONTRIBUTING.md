Submitting Code Changes

For code contributions, please follow these steps:

Fork the repository.

Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix (git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name or bugfix/your-bug-fix-name).

Make your changes, ensuring they adhere to the Coding Guidelines.

Write or update tests as necessary.

Ensure all existing tests pass.

Write clear, concise Commit Messages.

Push your branch to your fork.

Open a Pull Request to the develop branch of the main repository.

3. Development Setup
Refer to the main README.md file for detailed instructions on how to set up your local development environment, including prerequisites, installation steps, and how to run the application using Docker Compose or separately.

4. Coding Guidelines
General Principles

Readability: Write clean, well-structured, and easily understandable code.

Consistency: Follow existing code styles and patterns within the project.

Modularity: Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable modules.

Error Handling: Implement robust error handling on both client and server.

Security: Be mindful of security best practices, especially on the backend.

Frontend (React)

Use functional components and React Hooks.

Follow a consistent component structure (e.g., components/common, components/layout, components/auth).

Utilize Redux Toolkit for global state management.

Adhere to Tailwind CSS best practices for styling.

Ensure responsive design for various screen sizes.

Validate forms using Formik and Yup.

Backend (Node.js/Express)

Follow RESTful API design principles.

Use async/await for asynchronous operations.

Implement server-side validation using express-validator.

Handle errors gracefully using custom error middleware.

Ensure proper authentication and authorization checks for protected routes.

Use Mongoose for MongoDB interactions.

Maintain clear separation of concerns (routes -> controllers -> services -> models).

5. Testing
Unit Tests: Write unit tests for individual functions, services, and components.

For server: Jest.

For client: Jest (via react-scripts test).

Integration Tests: Write integration tests to ensure different modules and API endpoints work correctly together (server-side).

End-to-End (E2E) Tests: Use Cypress for testing complete user flows in the browser.

Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request.

6. Commit Messages
Please follow the Conventional Commits specification for your commit messages. This helps with automatic changelog generation and understanding the history of the project.

Examples:

feat: add user registration endpoint

fix: resolve bug in player statistics calculation

docs: update architecture overview

refactor: improve error handling in auth middleware

test: add unit tests for userService

7. Pull Request Guidelines
One Feature/Bug Per PR: Each pull request should address a single feature or bug fix.

Clear Title and Description: Provide a descriptive title and a detailed explanation of your changes. Reference any related issues (e.g., Fixes #123, Closes #456).

Self-Contained: Ensure your PR includes all necessary changes (code, tests, documentation updates).

Review: Be prepared for code review and be responsive to feedback.
